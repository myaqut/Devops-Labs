# Best Python Application Practises 

### 1- Proper Documentation.
Documentation is really important in development using any langauge. We need documentation in order to understand the other's work and let others understand owers. Without documentation you can't add features or edits any code written by another developers and it would take you hours. Documentation includes adding comments in your code as well as adding readme file attached to your project.

### 2- Follow Style Guides.
Style gudides are important for improving code quality and readability. PEP8  style guide for instance make it easier for others to read your code as well as make it easier for you to edit your own code. There are many extensions you can add to your IDE in order to apply the PEP8  style automatically while coding.

### 3- Exception Handling .
Exceptions are important in order to understand the reason why you code stopped working in case something wrong happened.

### 4- Use Virtual Enviroments
Adding virtual enviroment for each project prevent module clashing as you would need different versions of modules for each project.

### 5- Avoid Creating Global Variables
Adding global variables will make your variables accessible by different functions from different places. It will be very hard for you to trace back the changes happened to your variables. In addition to that, using global variables reduces efficiency of the memory.
